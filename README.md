# Victoria-3-IG-Candidates
A Victoria 3 mod

[h2][b]Tired of running into awkward randomly generated IG leaders?[/b][/h2] 
[spoiler]This mod adds more of them![/spoiler]

本模组为利益集团添加了一个新事件，让玩家可以从四个随机生成的候选人中为去世/卸任的利益集团领袖挑选继任者。取决于游戏规则，玩家可以选择为所有利益集团、政府中的利益集团、或者仅非边缘的利益集团提名候选人。
This mod adds a new event for interest group, allowing players to choose from four randomly generated candidates for each passing IG leader. Depending on the game rule, player can choose to nominate for either all IG, in-government IG, or only non-marginal IG.

[h1]New Events[/h1]
The [Leader Name] of [IG Name] has died / left office
Four options, allowing player to choose from four candidates

[h1]New Rule[/h1]
Nominate Leader for IG
all IG, in-government IG, or only non-marginal IG


[h1]Compatibility/h1]
本模组修改了character_events.100（结束领袖政治生涯的隐藏事件）。除此之外，本模组没有修改任何原版内容，.因此应当兼容大绝部分mod。对于添加了生成领袖事件组/机制的mod，使用本mod可能会导致意料之外的后果。
This mod modifies character_events.100. Beyond that, it doesn't change any vanilla files and should be compatible with most mods. For mods that add IG leader generation events / mechanics, this mod might produce unintended effects. If that's the case >>>
[b]Always select the first option. It does nothing and is free of side effects.[/b]

[h2]This mod is in early development. Feel free to comment![/h2]


[h1]Future Plans[/h1]
[list]
  [*] More testing
  [*] Add game rule about candidates number
  [*] Add logics to IG leader generation. Since this significantly reduces compatibility, we will upload them in a different mod.
[/list]

[h1]Have fun!![/h1]
